**About me:**

Hello, I'm Eldio, an aspiring brazilian data analyst.

ðŸŽ“ I'm undergraduating in Analysis and System Development for Uninabuco University.

I speak both portuguese and english.

I'm currently learning SQL specially for MySQL RDBMS to insert, retrieve and modify data structures. 

There's also a public repository right down below which I use as a portfolio named SQL-Progress 

where you can check the progress I've been managing to make lately.
